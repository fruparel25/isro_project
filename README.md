# isro project :3D Visulaization & Analyzation of Solar potential

# project overview:
To review currently available 3D City Model generating applications and finding solar potential area.

Building a website consisting development of 3D City Model using user uploaded GeoJSON file.

Generating Shadow Mapping files for the file which user has uploaded.

Finding solar potential on rooftop.

# project Scope:
For them who wants to install solar panels on their buildings without having prior knowledge to this environment, also for local authorities to manage urban areas.

This model can help professionals of diverse fields evaluating the solar energy potential of their projects, even without having a deep knowledge of the physics behind it, nor advanced programming skills.
